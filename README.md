## Installation

### Quick Install (macOS)

The easiest way to install DevTools on macOS is using our install script:

```bash
# System-wide installation (may require sudo)
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkz6/devtools/main/install.sh)"

# User-only installation (no sudo required)
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkz6/devtools/main/install.sh)" -- --user

# Alternative method (download and run)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkz6/devtools/main/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The install script will:

- Download the latest release
- Ask for sudo permission only if needed
- Install to `/usr/local/bin` (system) or `~/.local/bin` (user)
- Create the configuration directory at `~/.devtools`
- Provide PATH setup instructions if needed

### Manual Installation

#### From Release (Recommended)

1. Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kkz6/devtools/releases)
2. Extract and move to your PATH:

   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   chmod +x devtools-darwin-amd64
   sudo mv devtools-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/devtools

   # Verify installation
   devtools --version
   ```

#### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kkz6/devtools.git
cd devtools

# Build the application

# Run the application
devtools
```

### Homebrew (Coming Soon)

```bash
brew tap kkz6/devtools
brew install devtools
```

## Configuration

The application stores its configuration in `~/.devtools/config.yaml`. A default configuration file is created on first run.
